# This file defines the minimum symbol version number used by the
# system-provided libcrypt, for each CPU and OS where libxcrypt can be
# binary backward compatible with it.  See also lib/libcrypt.map.in,
# build-aux/scripts/compute-symver-floor, and
# build-aux/scripts/gen-libcrypt-map.
#
# Lines in this file that start with '#' are comments; # is not
# otherwise significant.  Blank lines are ignored.  All other lines
# must have three or four columns: VERSION, SYSTEM, CPU_FAMILY,
# and PREPROCESSOR_CHECK, in that order.
#
# VERSION is the minimum symbol version to use on hosts where SYSTEM
# and CPU_FAMILY match autoconf's $host_os and $host_cpu values,
# respectively, when interpreted as (Perl) regexes.  There is an implicit
# ^ at the beginning of each regex (that is, they must match starting
# at the beginning of the string) but there is no implicit $ at the end
# (that is, they do not have to match the entire string).  Use '.'
# to accept any string.
#
# If there is anything more on the line after the CPU_FAMILY field,
# all of it is taken as a preprocessor #if expression which must be
# true for this line's version number to be used.  The macros defined
# in <limits.h> are available to this expression.  This mechanism is
# for subarchitectures that do not change $host_cpu, e.g. x32 (I wish
# they wouldn't do that...)
#
# The symbol version XCRYPT_2.0 is special; if this file selects that
# version as the minimum for some platform, configure will
# automatically switch into --disable-obsolete-api mode.  This is used
# for platforms where either we have not yet implemented binary
# backward compatibility with the system-provided libcrypt, or we know
# there is no system-provided libcrypt to be compatible with.
#
# The symbol version ERROR is special; if this file selects that
# version as the minimum for some platform, configuration will fail.
# This is used for platforms where we know we ought to support
# backward binary compatibility and the library shouldn't be allowed
# to be used until someone's set this up properly.
#
# More specific regexes must be sorted below less specific ones, and
# empty PREPROCESSOR_CHECK must be sorted below non-empty.  If neither
# constraint applies, sort entries in descending order of symbol
# version within one SYSTEM, and in alphabetical order of CPU_FAMILY
# within each symbol version.
#
# Future cleanup: the ERROR lines for 'gnu*', 'kfreebsd*gnu*', and
# 'linux*gnu*' can be removed once GNU libc stops shipping libcrypt.
# It will be correct to use XCRYPT_2.0 as the minimum symbol version
# for any platform added to glibc after that release.
