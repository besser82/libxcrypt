/* A program that uses encrypt_r necessarily uses setkey_r as well,

   file' principle and have both encrypt_r and setkey_r in this file,
   and the cpp conditionals do not allow for only one of them being
   included in the library.  encrypt/setkey are implemented in terms
   of encrypt_r/setkey_r, so most of this code is enabled for either.  */
